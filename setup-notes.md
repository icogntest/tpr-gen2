# Setup Notes

To get the release action working, from the repo do the following:

- Click on "Settings".
- Expand "Actions" and click "General".
- Change "Workflow permissions" to "Read and write permissions".
- Click "Save".

In package.json, you also need to update the `repository.url` to point to the correct repo.
